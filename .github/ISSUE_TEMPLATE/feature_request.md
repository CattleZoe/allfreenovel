You believe Fictioneer would benefit from another feature or an extension? Very well, make your case, but take the following into consideration.

Fictioneer is open-source and completely free, yet it still requires work to improve and maintain. There are limits to what you can reasonably expect. Ask yourself, would you work the equivalent of a second full time job without compensation? Are you entitled to demand that from others?

There are two types of feature requests. Those that genuinely improve the core functionality for the target audience, namely single authors and small collectives — and those that fulfill unique requirements, solve minor inconveniences, or are out of scope. I will tell you what is what, so just ask nicely.

The first is likely done for free *if reasonable* (I’m just one guy). The second requires a payed commission *if feasible* and not against my principles. We can figure this out together, just write me in Discord. But keep in mind that in the spirit of open-source-ness, any feature you pay for will be added to the theme for everyone to enjoy. You get to freely enjoy the results of my labor as well, after all. Several features have already been sponsored this way. Sharing is caring.
