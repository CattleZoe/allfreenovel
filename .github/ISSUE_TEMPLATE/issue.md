You can report bugs, suggest improvements, and even request features here. However, because Fictioneer is open-source and completely free, there are limits to what you can reasonably expect. Not everything can be implemented without compensation.

Beyond that, I do take commissions for customizations and new features. Just write me in Discord and we can figure out what is feasible. But keep in mind that any feature you pay for will be added to the theme for everyone to enjoy. After all, you are also benefiting from my years of work. Several features have already been sponsored this way. Sharing is caring.

Please delete this explanation before opening the issue.
