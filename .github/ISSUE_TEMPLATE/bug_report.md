You believe you have found a bug? I would say nice, but we both know that would be a lie. Please make sure to give a detailed description of the problem, how you encountered it, how to reproduce it, append any error logs or warnings, browser console outputs, and screenshots if that makes sense â€” to the best of your ability. Also look at the FAQ and guides and flush your permalinks (often the cause of all troubles).

If you are using plugins, first check whether they are the cause and list them. Many plugins just do not work well with Fictioneer, and compatibility issues with third parties are not bugs. Chances are, you do not need the plugins anyway or they do more harm than good. With notable exceptions.

Not everything going against your expectation is a bug, mind you. Fictioneer does many things different than other themes, and sometimes what you encountered is intentional or deliberately not implemented. You can still ask, of course! Maybe Discord is faster and less public, though.

Please delete this explanation before opening the issue.
